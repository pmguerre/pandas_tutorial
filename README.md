# Pandas Tutorial

These are the Jupyter notebooks that I've made by watching the Pandas Tutorials by Corey Schafer. Here are the links to the series [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-osiE80TeTsWmV9i9c58mdDCSskIFdDS), and the [Github repository](https://github.com/CoreyMSchafer/code_snippets/tree/master/Python/Pandas)

Kudos to him
